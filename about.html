            <h1>Artist & Producer</h1>
            <p>Music has always been a passion, from song writing to production and to performing my own music.
               <br class="remove one">I make music to make you dance, smile and forget about your daily stressors. And as much as I want the fame and riches. I make music to have fun.
               <br class="remove two">I've been making music since I was 12, and even with the whole "soundcloud rapper" stereotype, <br class="remove four">I kept going.
                I'm on Apple music, Spotify and SoundCloud. <br class="remove three"> Click the music tab and allow me to take you on a journey.
